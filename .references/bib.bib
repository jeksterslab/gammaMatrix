  abstract     = {Commonly used formulae for standard error (SE) estimates in covariance structure analysis are derived under the assumption of a correctly specified model. In practice, a model is at best only an approximation to the real world. It is important to know whether the estimates of SEs as provided by standard software are consistent when a model is misspecified, and to understand why if not. Bootstrap procedures provide nonparametric estimates of SEs that automatically account for distribution violation. It is also necessary to know whether bootstrap estimates of SEs are consistent. This paper studies the relationship between the bootstrap estimates of SEs and those based on asymptotics. Examples are used to illustrate various versions of asymptotic variance–covariance matrices and their validity. Conditions for the consistency of the bootstrap estimates of SEs are identified and discussed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the relationship of different estimates of SEs and covariance matrices.},

Analytical results indicate that the formulas for SEs given in popular text books are consistent only when the population value of the regression coefficient is zero. The sample standardized regression coefficients are also biased in general, although it should not be a concern in practice when the sample size is not too small. Monte Carlo results imply that, for both standardized and unstandardized sample regression coefficients, SE estimates based on asymptotics tend to under-predict the empirical ones at smaller sample sizes.},

  abstract     = {The asymptotically distribution-free (ADF) test statistic for covariance structure analysis (CSA) has been reported to perform very poorly in simulation studies, i.e. it leads to inaccurate decisions regarding the adequacy of models of psychological processes. It is shown in the present study that the poor performance of the ADF test statistic is due to inadequate estimation of the weight matrix (W = −l), which is a critical quantity in the ADF theory. Bootstrap procedures based on Hall's bias reduction perspective are proposed to correct the ADF test statistic. It is shown that the bootstrap correction of additive bias on the ADF test statistic yields the desired tail behaviour as the sample size reaches 500 for a 15-variable-3-factor confirmatory factor-analytic model, even if the distribution of the observed variables is not multivariate normal and the latent factors are dependent. These results help to revive the ADF theory in CSA.},
