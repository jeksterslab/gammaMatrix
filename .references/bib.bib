This asymptotic covariance matrix is consistently estimated without the computation of the empirical fourth order moment matrix. Using quasi-maximum likelihood theory a Hausman misspecification test is developed. This test is sensitive to misspecification caused by errors that are correlated with the independent variables. This misspecification cannot be detected by the test statistics currently used in covariance structure analysis.},

When such a procedure is applied to the estimation of the parameters of the first order moments, it is possible to prove a necessary and sufficient condition for its consistency. Asymptotic normality is shown as well as the existence of a lower bound for the asymptotic covariance matrix. It is also seen that this bound can be reached if consistent estimates are available for the parameters of the second order moments. Finally, a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency if the pseudo maximum likelihood estimation of the first and second moments is given.},

The quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (OMLE) converges to a well defined limit, and may or may not be consistent for particular parameters of interest. Standard tests (Wald, Lagrange Multiplier, or Likelihood Ratio) are invalid in the presence of misspecification, but more general statistics are given which allow inferences to be drawn robustly. The properties of the QMLE and the information matrix are exploited to yield several useful tests for model misspecification.},

  abstract     = {Survey and longitudinal studies in the social and behavioral sciences generally contain missing data. Mean and covariance structure models play an important role in analyzing such data. Two promising methods for dealing with missing data are a direct maximum-likelihood and a two-stage approach based on the unstructured mean and covariance estimates obtained by the EM-algorithm. Typical assumptions under these two methods are ignorable nonresponse and normality of data. However, data sets in social and behavioral sciences are seldom normal, and experience with these procedures indicates that normal theory based methods for nonnormal data very often lead to incorrect model evaluations. By dropping the normal distribution assumption, we develop more accurate procedures for model inference. Based on the theory of generalized estimating equations, a way to obtain consistent standard errors of the two-stage estimates is given. The asymptotic efficiencies of different estimators are compared under various assumptions. We also propose a minimum chi-square approach and show that the estimator obtained by this approach is asymptotically at least as efficient as the two likelihood-based estimators for either normal or nonnormal data. The major contribution of this paper is that for each estimator, we give a test statistic whose asymptotic distribution is chisquare as long as the underlying sampling distribution enjoys finite fourth-order moments. We also give a characterization for each of the two likelihood ratio test statistics when the underlying distribution is nonnormal. Modifications to the likelihood ratio statistics are also given. Our working assumption is that the missing data mechanism is missing completely at random. Examples and Monte Carlo studies indicate that, for commonly encountered nonnormal distributions, the procedures developed in this paper are quite reliable even for samples with missing data that are missing at random.},

  abstract     = {Commonly used formulae for standard error (SE) estimates in covariance structure analysis are derived under the assumption of a correctly specified model. In practice, a model is at best only an approximation to the real world. It is important to know whether the estimates of SEs as provided by standard software are consistent when a model is misspecified, and to understand why if not. Bootstrap procedures provide nonparametric estimates of SEs that automatically account for distribution violation. It is also necessary to know whether bootstrap estimates of SEs are consistent. This paper studies the relationship between the bootstrap estimates of SEs and those based on asymptotics. Examples are used to illustrate various versions of asymptotic varianceâ€“covariance matrices and their validity. Conditions for the consistency of the bootstrap estimates of SEs are identified and discussed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the relationship of different estimates of SEs and covariance matrices.},

The sample standardized regression coefficients are also biased in general, although it should not be a concern in practice when the sample size is not too small. Monte Carlo results imply that, for both standardized and unstandardized sample regression coefficients, SE estimates based on asymptotics tend to under-predict the empirical ones at smaller sample sizes.},

  abstract     = {The asymptotically distribution-free (ADF) test statistic for covariance structure analysis (CSA) has been reported to perform very poorly in simulation studies, i.e. it leads to inaccurate decisions regarding the adequacy of models of psychological processes. It is shown in the present study that the poor performance of the ADF test statistic is due to inadequate estimation of the weight matrix (W = âˆ’l), which is a critical quantity in the ADF theory. Bootstrap procedures based on Hall's bias reduction perspective are proposed to correct the ADF test statistic. It is shown that the bootstrap correction of additive bias on the ADF test statistic yields the desired tail behaviour as the sample size reaches 500 for a 15-variable-3-factor confirmatory factor-analytic model, even if the distribution of the observed variables is not multivariate normal and the latent factors are dependent. These results help to revive the ADF theory in CSA.},
